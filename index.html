    <h2>Introduction: Challenges and the Need for Data Integration</h2>
    <p>The Brazilian healthcare sector faces significant challenges related to the fragmentation and dispersion of patient data, which directly harms the efficiency, safety, and quality of care. Medical data is often scattered across different establishments, disconnected systems, and diverse formats, making it difficult to access complete and secure information. To address this issue, we present the proposal for an Integrated Health Record, a solution that promotes decentralized and secure integration of health records.</p>

    <h2>The Integrated Health Record: A Patient-Centered Approach</h2>
    <p>The Integrated Health Record aims to develop a technological platform that allows centralized access to health information while keeping the data under the direct control of patients. Unlike previous attempts that required major structural changes in local systems, the Integrated Health Record operates in a complementary and decentralized manner.</p>

    <h2>How the Proposed Solution Works</h2>
    <p>The solution operates through an additional technological layer over the systems already used in health institutions, requiring no significant structural changes. The Integrated Health Record securely captures records with patient authorization through simple browser extensions or mobile applications, ensuring flexibility and ease of adoption.</p>

    <p>The collected data is processed and organized by Artificial Intelligence (AI), structuring it into a unified electronic health record. This record is stored in decentralized ledger networks (DLT), ensuring security, privacy, anonymity, and auditability. Access to the integrated records is securely conducted through mobile applications with biometric authentication, giving patients full control.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of the Integrated Health Record</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For Patients:</strong> Immediate and secure access to complete medical history, enabling accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments.</li>
      <li><strong>For Healthcare Professionals:</strong> Significant reduction in administrative burden, access to detailed clinical summaries, and greater security in clinical decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>For the Healthcare System:</strong> Reduced unnecessary repetition of exams, optimized resource utilization, and improved operational efficiency of healthcare services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step During a Routine Medical Appointment</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The patient pre-authorizes access to their integrated record via the mobile app.</li>
      <li>During the consultation, the extension activates and captures information shown on the screen of the local system.</li>
      <li>This information is processed by AI and immediately organized into the integrated electronic health record.</li>
      <li>The physician accesses the integrated record using both the patient's and their own credentials through the same extension, which also allows interaction with the AI.</li>
      <li>At the end of the consultation, all new information is automatically recorded and synchronized with the system.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Technical Aspects for Implementation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Development of dedicated decentralized networks using blockchain or similar technology.</li>
      <li>Programming of smart contracts for automatic and transparent validation of recorded information.</li>
      <li>Modular architecture with open standards for interoperability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Public Call for Development</h2>
    <p>A public call is suggested to encourage active participation from the market and public and private entities. This call would aim to foster technology companies to develop scalable solutions based on prototypes.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Integrated Health Record presents a real opportunity to positively transform the current healthcare landscape in Brazil, promoting greater efficiency, safety, and quality of care through effective collaboration between public and private sectors.</p>
